Addressability = number of bits in each location (If the addressability is 2 bytes, each memory location corresponds to 2 bytes of data.)

each location is addressed by an amount of bits where 0000... represents the first location in memory and 1111... the last. That means that if each location has 2 bits and we have 15 locations (the bits that are needed to address each location are 15) then the total number of bits that can be stored are 2^15

decoders just translate the binary input into decimal values (for example 2-4 decoder will take 11 and then only the 4th output will be active)
