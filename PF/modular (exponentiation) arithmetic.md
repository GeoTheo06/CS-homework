we want 2^100 so with powers of 2 i can rewrite 100 as:
100 = 64 + 32 +4. this means that: because of exponentiation properties
2^100 = 2^64 * 2^32 * 2^4 
and for the next one you have to understand the modular exponentiation that the 3rd week's pdf covers but i think thats the easy part:
(2^64mod100 * 2^32mod100 * 2^ 4mod100) mod 100 = 

6^8mod1000
5^8mod1000*5mod1000=
